This module enhances filtering by enabling users to enter additional filter tokens. The Code or Text filters accept the %me, %user, and %company filter tokens. The Date, Time, and DateTime filters accept the %today, %workdate, %yesterday, %tomorrow, %week, %month, %quarter filter tokens. In addition, the Date filters support date formulas. Developer can add more filter tokens by subscribing to the OnResolveDateFilterToken, OnResolveTextFilterToken, OnResolveTimeFilterToken, OnResolveDateTokenFromDateTimeFilter and OnResolveTimeTokenFromDateTimeFilter events.
